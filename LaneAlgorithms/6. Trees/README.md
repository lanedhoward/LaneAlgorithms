# Trees

A tree is a data structure that puts values into a hierarchy.
Each value is a node, and each node can point to child nodes.

Trees only point one direction (down / away from the root). 
And each node can only have one parent.

## Binary Trees

Binary trees are a type of tree where each node only has up to two children.

Binary trees can be sorted into a Binary Search Tree, 
where every node's value is greater than every value in the left subtree, 
and less than every value in the right subtree.

Binary search trees are used in Heaps, which is the data structure used in Heapsort.
