# Fisher-Yates Shuffle

The Fisher-Yates shuffle is an algorithm that shuffles a collection so that each possible permutation is equally likely.
Basically, it is a true, fair shuffle.
It might seem at first that a shuffling algorithm would be very simple. 
However, many intuitive shuffle implementations fall into traps that lead to an unfair distribution of results.
The Fisher-Yates shuffle avoids this.
In Shuffler.cs, I wrote two implementations of the Fisher-Yates shuffle.
